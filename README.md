# ESP32 Switch State Project

### Project Overview
The ESP32 Switch State project demonstrates how to read the state of a switch using an ESP32 microcontroller. This project is useful for applications where detecting the state of a switch (on/off) is necessary, such as in home automation, security systems, and user interfaces.

### Components Needed
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Controls and reads the state of the switch.
- **Switch**: A physical switch to toggle between two states.
- **Jumper Wires**: Connects the switch to the ESP32.
- **Breadboard**: Optional, for organizing circuit connections.

### Block Diagram

### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Switch to ESP32:**
   - **Switch Pin (switchPin)**: Connect one terminal of the switch to GPIO 4 on the ESP32.
   - **Power Supply**: Connect the other terminal of the switch to ground (GND).

### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize Serial communication using `Serial.begin(9600)` for debugging purposes.
   - Configure `switchPin` as an input with an internal pull-up resistor using `pinMode()`.

2. **Operation:**
   - **Reading Switch State:**
     - Use `digitalRead(switchPin)` to read the state of the switch (HIGH or LOW).
     - Print the switch state ("Switch is ON" or "Switch is OFF") based on the read value.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Debouncing:** Implement additional debouncing techniques if the switch state fluctuates due to mechanical bouncing.
   - **Switch Type:** Adjust the logic based on whether the switch is active HIGH or LOW.

### Applications
- **Home Automation:** Detect switch state changes to control lights, appliances, or other devices.
- **Security Systems:** Monitor the state of security sensors or alarm triggers.
- **User Interfaces:** Input control for interactive devices and interfaces.
